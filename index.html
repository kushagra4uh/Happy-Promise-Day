    <h1>My Maharni ðŸ‘‘,</h1>
    <p>On this <span class="main">Promise Day</span> I'm grateful for your presence in my life, my Maharani. Every day, my feelings for you grow stronger, even though I know you have someone else in your heart.  
      <br></br>
    <br>Today, I want to make a promise to you - a promise to be there for you, even though I know you may not feel the same way about me. Even if there's just 0.00000001% of hope, that you could be mine, still I'll keep trying. I promise to quietly support you, to be your silent strength, and to cherish every moment I spend thinking of you. I'll be your your eternal well-wisher. I'll try to understand you, to admire you from afar, and to share in your joys, offer comfort in your sorrows. I'll hold you in the highest regard, honor you in my thoughts. But most importantly, I promise to love you fiercely and endlessly, despite knowing you may never feel the same way about me. You are my light, my love, and my inspiration. Happy Promise Day, my beloved Maharani.</p>
